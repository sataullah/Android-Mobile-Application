# Android-Mobile-Application
The scope of this project is to design a workplace wellbeing application that is envisioned to ameliorate employee wellbeing whilst their time in the office. 
A noteworthy feature of the application is that it entails the employee to take a quick test indicative of their mood and select the factor that may have had an influence on the current mood. 
In addition, the application also entreats the user to input a positive influence from their day. At the end of the week or month, the data collected is aggregated and the employee can choose to view their progression.
The application also strives to encourage employees to tranquilise so as to break away from the sedentary routines at the workplace by sending them notifications for screen breaks and water breaks at regular intervals.
